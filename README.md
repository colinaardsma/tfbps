# Grays Sports Almanac
A fantasy baseball projection site.

## What it does
While still very much a work in progress I have acheived a few of my main goals:
* Data import/export/analysis:
    * Parse HTML projection (table) data from external sites
    * Analyze data and return value for each player
    * Communicate with Yahoo! Fantasy Sports API to import users' custom league data
    * Analyze Free Agents and rank
    * Project final league standings
    * Analyze potential trades
* Users:
    * Login/Logout/Register
    * Divide users into groups with permissions varying by group

## What's coming up
* Data import/export/analysis:
    * Allow users to create their own calculations
    * Recommend potential trades
    * Recommend Free Agents based on projected final league standings
* Users:
    * Storing of personalized data
